/* PRE BONUS EXERCISE TEXT

1a. Create a const variable called "mulan" and set the value to an object with the following properties (Property name of "title" with the value set to the following string `Mulan` & a property name of "main" with the value set to the following string `Fa Mulan`)
1b. Create a method in the mulan object called "quote" that RETURNS the following string `Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family!`
1c. Create another method called "storyline" that RETURNS the following string `The movie Mulan is about Fa Mulan.` by using the THIS keyword to access the values of "Mulan" & "Fa Mulan".

//1a
const mulan = {title =`Mulan`, main =`Fa Mulan`
    // 1b should `` be changed to ""?
    quote:() => "Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family!";
    //1c 
    storyline(){
        //   THIS (keyword) is used to refer to the object contains the following properties.
        return `The movie ${this.title} is about ${main}`;
}
    
/*2a. Create another const variable called "tangled" and set the value to an object with the following properties (Property name of "title" with the value set to the following string `Tangled` & a property name of "main" with the value set to the following string `Rapunzel`).
2b. Create a method in the tangled object called "quote" that RETURNS the following string `I can't believe I did this! I can't believe I did this! I have to go home! I am never going back! I'm a horrible daughter! BEST DAY EVER!`
2c. Create another method called "storyline" that RETURNS the following string `The movie Tangled is about Rapunzel.` by using the THIS keyword to access the values of "Tangled" and "Rapunzel"
3a. Create a constructor function called "disneyMovie" that takes in the following parameters ("title" and "main") and sets them as properties. (HINT: You will need to use the THIS keyword)
3b. Using the PROTOTYPE keyword, copy the "storyline" method from questions 1 & 2 and add it as a prototype on the disneyMovie constructor function
3c. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object that matches the "mulan" object from question 1 by passing in the appropriate values and set the new created object to a const variable called mulan1
3d. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object that matches the "tangled" object from question 2 by passing in the appropriate values and set the new created object to a const variable called tangled1
4a.?? Create a class called "DM" that has a constructor that takes the following parameters ("title" & "main") and sets them as properties. (HINT: You will need to use the THIS keyword) (NOTE: DM stands for "Disney Movie")
4b. Below the constructor, copy the "storyline" method from questions 1-3 and add it as a prototype on the DM class
4c. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object that matches the mulan object from question 1 by passing in the appropriate values and set the new created object to a const variable called mulan2
4d. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object that matches the tangled object from question 2 by passing in the appropriate values and set the new created object to a const variable called tangled2
4e. In the DM class create a static method called "loveDisneyMovies" that returns the following string `I Love Disney Movies!`
4f. Using the DM class name, run the loveDisneyMovies method (NOTE: You will need to put it in a console log if you want to see the returned value display in terminal)
5a. Using the EXTENDS keyword create a subclass of the DM class called "DMCast"
5b. Inside the DMCast subclass create a constructor that takes the following parameters ("title", "main", & "cast").
5c. Inside the constructor use the SUPER keyword to get the "title" & "main" properties from the DM parent class. Also, set the cast parameter as a new property (HINT: You will need to use the THIS keyword)
5d. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object by passing in the same values from question 4c. However, pass in the following object for the value of the "cast" property {mulan: `Ming-Na Wen`, mushu: `Eddie Murphy`, shang: `BD Wong`, theEmperor: `Pat Morita`} and set the entire new created object to a const variable called mulan3
5e. Using the NEW keyword, create a new object by passing in the same values from question 4d. However, pass in the following object for the value of the "cast" property {rapunzel: `Mandy Moore`, flynnRider: `Zachary Levi`, motherGothel: `Donna Murphy`} and set the entire new created object to a const variable called rapunzel3
